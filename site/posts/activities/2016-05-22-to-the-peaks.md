A training ride out with Hannah and Jonathon. I remember this being a nice day out, and that we visited a vegetarian cafe in the peak district. I had no idea where it was, until the year after when we visited the Peak district and stumbled across this same cafe! The cafe was at Caudwellâ€™s Mill at Rowsley, which was also very interesting to visit.
