I've updated my now page with what I am doing since lock-down started:

- Starting to document my life around me, through [Black and White](/tags/black_and_white/) film photography ðŸ“·
- Exploring my local area, especially the Olympic Park
- Going to tech [meet-ups](/tags/meetup/) at least once a month (Lock-down has helped with online meet-ups!)
- [Cycling](/tags/cycling/) more often. My aim is to cycle home from Southend once lock-down is over
- Taking care of my mental health
