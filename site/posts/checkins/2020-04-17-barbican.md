Today, I went on an extended cycle into the centre of London (to remind myself that I do live in this city). I was promised deserted streets like scenes from 28 Days Later. But it seems like life is still going on. Buses are running, deliveries are still being made and people were exercising in the park.

_Perhaps you need to be up at the crack of dawn to get a photo of an empty Trafalgar Square?_

My route took me down Victoria Embankment, through Westminster (seeing the Pelicans at St. James's Park), the not-so-silent Trafalgar square, then... I got lost ðŸ˜…. Thankfully I popped out at Russell Square, made it to Euston and headed to the Barbican (via Angel) - one of my favourite places to visit in the City.
