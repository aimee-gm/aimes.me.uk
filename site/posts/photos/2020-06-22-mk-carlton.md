The 19th Century chimney was part of the M.K. Associates Carlton Shoe Company. It currently sits in a building site for the construction of a new foot bridge between Fish Island and the Olympic Park. Like most of this area, many old Victorian buildings are nestled amongst the increasing number of new redevelopments, such as this modern block of flats.
