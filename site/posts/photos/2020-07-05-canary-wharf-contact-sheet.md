Last week, we set out for a walk around the Isle of Dogs, visiting Canary Wharf, Heron Quays and West India Pier before torrential rain started! We had to abandon our walk around the headland, and headed towards Crossharbour DLR station. After the rain cleared up, we explored around Millwall Inner and Outer Docks before heading home from Heron Quays.
