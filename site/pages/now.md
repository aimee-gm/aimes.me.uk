A [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page - what i'm either up to or trying to focus on. For a more general about me, see the [home page](/).

## What I am doing in Lock-down

- Starting to document my life around me, through [Black and White](/tags/black_and_white/) film photography 📷
- Exploring my local area, especially the Olympic Park
- Going to [tech meet-ups](/tags/meetup/) at least once a month (Lock-down has helped with online meet-ups!)
- [Cycling](/tags/cycling/) more often. My aim is to cycle home from Southend once lock-down is over
- Taking care of my mental health

## What was trying to do

- 🚇 Trying to visit every London Underground station before I move out of London
- 🤘 Going to more [(metal) gigs](/tags/gig/)
- 🏖 Visiting the [sea side](/tags/beach/) at least once a month

## What I am meaning to do

- 👩‍💻 Go to a tech meet up at least once a month (I have stopped since moving to London 😢)
- 🎤 Talk at some tech meet ups
- 🚴‍♀️ Join a cycling club

## Trying to learn

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- Non-application based web development (such as this site and [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) things)

## Programming languages

At the moment, I'm mostly using:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
  - React
  - Node.js
- HTML/CSS
